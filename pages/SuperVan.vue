					Traveling with a slightly larger group of people can be a daunting idea, especially when it comes to booking a vehicle! With 6 adults in tow, the normal sedan-variant vehicles simply won’t be a practical option. Book a MPV SuperVan with us today and we will see to it that your entourage will be ferried to your destination in comfort and with smiles!

					Our SuperVan is a 6-seater vehicle which comes with a side lift-up seat and passenger lift-up seat that allows the passengers to easily enter and exit the car. Capable of seating up to 6 adults, the spacious interior offers passengers a chance to sit back and relax during the transfer, and, as a bonus feature, the vehicle also comes with cup holders for the passengers’ convenience.
