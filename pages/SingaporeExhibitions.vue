				<h2>Singapore Exhibition &amp; Trade Fairs</h2>

				<p style="font-size:15px;">
					Singapore is home to many trade fairs and exhibitions with many companies from the Middle East, Asia and further afield visiting to get the latest information on products and techniques in their field.
				<br><br>
					Suntec Singapore is located on Raffles Boulevard in Suntec City and is home to one of the largest convention centres in Singapore. Suntec is a 20-minute journey from Changi International Airport. Singapore`s MRT and buses all have excellent routes from the airport to the convention centre with the nearest MRT station being Esplanade station. If you prefer to have a walk before visiting the convention centre, the City Mall station is a 10-minute walk through the underground City Link Mall.
				<br><br>
					Suntec Singapore is also easily accessible by road with the Central expressway and East Coast expressway servicing the central business district where Suntec is located. Suntec Singapore has its own underground parking basement with spaces for up to 3,200 cars. Suntec has convention halls, exhibition halls, a gallery, theatre, concourse, ballrooms and a central lobby. There are many services available in the centre including banqueting, bid assistance and support services.
				<br><br>
					The Marina Bay Sands hotel and convention centre is located in the marina area of Singapore. The centre can hold up to 45,000 delegates with 250 meeting rooms, 2,000 exhibition booths and a ballroom. The hotel is a 4-minute walk from the MRT station at Marina Bay or 10 minutes from the Promenade station. There are also buses that stop outside the hotel. The hotel has excellent facilities including swimming pools, business rooms, fax and email and copying services. The whole complex also incorporates a shopping mall, theme park and casino.
				<br><br>
					The Singapore EXPO is located on EXPO Drive in close proximity to the airport. Singapore EXPO has many conference halls, exhibition halls, meeting rooms, mobile rooms and over 12,300sqm of outdoor and indoor space. The EXPO usually has just over six million visitors a year and can be used for shows, banquets, corporate meetings, exhibitions and ceremonies.
				<br><br>
					The centre has full Wi-Fi access, 3G mobile services and a large business centre. Other facilities include prayer rooms, ATMs and internet kiosks. If you are visiting the EXPO by car, you can use the Tampines, Pan Island or East Coast expressways. There is also a park and ride service available from Changi Airport with a short MRT ride to the EXPO station. The MRT ride from Changi Airport to the EXPO station will take approximately 12 minutes and the station is then located behind Hall 6 of the EXPO centre. The EXPO centre is also easily accessible by bus with buses stopping either at car park G or J and outside Hall Number 1.
				<br><br>
					The range of shows and exhibitions available to visit in Singapore are very varied from multimedia shows to pharmaceutical engineering conferences. All of the major hotels in Singapore also have business and conferencing facilities, so when you are away from your chosen exhibition you can catch up on any business that needs to be taken care of. The international airport at Changi is approximately a 6-hour flight from most regional countries. Some international flights from further afield may require a stop over in one of the many Bangkok hotels.
